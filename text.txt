2. VAr vs Let

In the following text we come to know the major difference between var and let in javascript.

The main difference between let and var is that scope of a variable defined with let is limited to the block in which it is declared while variable declared with var has the global scope. So we can say that var is rather a keyword which defines a variable globally regardless of block scope.

The scope of let not only limited to the block in which it is defined but variable with let also do not get added with global window object even if it get declared outside of any block. But we can access variable with var from window object if it is defined globally.

Due to limited scope let variables are usually used when there is limited use of those variables such as in for loops, while loops or inside the scope of if conditions etc while var variable is used when value of variable need to be less change and used to accessed globally.

Also, one difference between var and let is variable with var can be redeclared to some other value while variable could not be redeclared if it is defined with let.

let a = 'hello'; // globally scoped
var b = 'world'; // globally scoped
console.log(window.a); // undefined
console.log(window.b); // 'world'
var a = 'hello';
var a = 'world'; // No problem, 'hello' is replaced.
let b = 'hello';
let b = 'world'; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'b' has already been declared

17. sapn tag
Span tag in HTML is considered as an inline element. It is similar to the div tag, but the div tag is purposely used for block-level elements, whereas the span is used for inline elements. It’s mainly used whenever a user wants to do a grouping of the inline elements into their code structure. Span tag in HTML is used to give style to particular contents by using elements class or id attribute. It’s not possible to do visual change by itself using the span tag in the HTML document. It works as an inline tag in the HTML document. Using the span tags in your code helps to reduce code and HTML attributes.

19.What is React JS?
React JS is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces, making development of UI components easy and modular.
*********************************************************
States?
States are mutable and only used on top level component

They are reserved only for interactivity and component's event handlers may change to trigger a UI update

The state will be set with a default value when component mounts and will mutate in time based on user events generated
